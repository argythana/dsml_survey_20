    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kaggle DS & ML Survey is an open online survey receiving thousands of responses from all over the world, offering unique insights. This analysis tries to achieve the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the identification of spam data, which is a fundamental principal method and goal of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).\n",
    "- examining the profile of Data Scientists with an emphasis on the subject of compensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kaggle DS & ML Survey being a global online survey is affected by factors that Machine Learning is often used to mitigate: *spam* and *user error*. According to the Survey Methodology, *spam* has already been excluded from the data. Nevertheless, using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) we find that a large part of the data should be removed from the dataset for being spam or for having abnormal, irregular values. Using relatively lenient criteria we manage to remove such observations without dropping possible outliers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis comprises the following unique features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filtering the data, which is a principal feature and a goal in itself.\n",
    "- Comparing the filtered dataset with the Unfiltered one in order to provide additional insights.\n",
    "- Grouping countries according to the World Bank \"Income Groups\" definition to account for the wide economic diversity.\n",
    "- Reconstructing the various classes (bins) in which the data are provided to account for their width and their underlying properties.\n",
    "- Excluding USA and India from global or group aggregates, thus offering a alternative view on the pronounced symmetric differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key findings are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are at least 3861 observations (19.3% of the dataset) than need to be removed, of which 596 \"Data Scientists\" (22.3% of the subset).\n",
    "- Data Scientists tend to hold, or aim for, higher academic degrees compared to what the unfiltered data shows.\n",
    "- Median salaries are significantly higher and salary distribution is shifted towards higher ranges. For example, the median salary for Data Scientists in India is double than what the unfiltered data suggest.\n",
    "- The age distribution density is much higher in younger ages compared to what the unfiltered data shows..\n",
    "- US-based data scientists are more experienced, while for the same levels of experience, they earn almost double compared to their colleages in other high income countries.\n",
    "- The Data Scientist's salary increases significantly with Coding and Machine Learning Experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contributions of our work are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A fundamentally different methodological framework on the issues of data filtering, observations aggregation and observations decomposition.\n",
    "- The combination of several economic databases to create a new dataset that proxies the average salary in most countries of the world.\n",
    "- The creation of a dedicated python library that makes our analysis reproducible, easy to parametrize and allows exploring different dimensions of the dataset using the afore-mentioned methodology."

    "# 1. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) Examining Survey questions, answer choices and data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of our EDA is dedicated to exploring abnormal/invalid observation values that have not be flagged as spam by the survey system, but should be definetely removed from the dataset. We use the Kaggle *Executive Summary* as a \"benchmark\", but our results also differ from all other EDAs that explore the data without filtering them first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of unacceptable values and the criteria that we had to set, highlight the principal importance and challenges of exploring the data for errors and cleaning them before embarking on any other kind of analysis.  Besides unacceptable values, we find mispecifications in \"Questions\" and \"Answer Choices\" that may lead to unfounded conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Adjusting for cross-country economic differences\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of meaningful information on compensation levels cannot be understated in a field that transcends national borders like few others.  Nevertheless, the differences among different economies are so profound that a global view on Data Scientist salary distribution shows an \"everything goes\" result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides calculating a more representative salary median for each country, we group the countries according to the World Bank Income Groups and explore the salary distribution per group of countries. This allows us in turn to explore in a meaningful way the effect that experience levels have on salary in each income group. We find that _experience_ influences salary levels and leads to significant within-group differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) Reconstruction of data aggregated bins (classes)\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey uses different classes width for various dimensions (e.g. age, salary and experience).\n",
    "This is informative and convenient for aggregating observations but comes with a trade-off; a large amount of information is lost.  Unequal bins size leads to \"over\" or \"under\" representation of data, depending on the relative width difference and the number of observations.  It may  also distort information and create \"illusions\" in visual representations. Therefore, we reconstruct bins when necessary and gain new and useful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### d) USA versus Rest of World (RoW) symmetric difference comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the aggregate metrics of a subset of the data with the overall aggregates we examine whether the subset in question influences heavily the aggregated values.  It is often informative to compare a subset with low number of observations against the total, to asses how it measures against it.  On the contrary, if a subset has substantial weight, then information is distorted since the subset affects the total to a significant degree.  In that case, comparing the symmetric difference adds valuable information. Therefore, when comparing the USA, or India we exclude it from the total."

    "# 2. Creating a global average salary dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine whether there exist observations with extremely low salary values we had to define what consitutes a \"low\" salary for each country. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since salaries in each country vary significantly, we need to use a different rejection threshold. Besides Eurostat, we found that International Organizations' databases on average salaries contain missing our outdated values for a large number of countries. Therefore, we combine data from seven different sources to obtain an *approximation* for the annual average salary of each country (`country_avg_salary`) and cross-validate our selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the official average salary data from Eurostat for the European Union countries and the United Kingdom (UK).\n",
    "- the World Bank Gross National Income per capita value (GNI pc), which is the measure used by the World Bank to define country \"Income groups\" for all the remaining countries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We compared these values with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the WB \"Income Groups\" for countries.\n",
    "- the WB Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDB pc).\n",
    "- the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average salary data.\n",
    "- the International Labour Organizaton (ILO) average salary data.\n",
    "- unofficial data from \"numbeo.com\".\n",

    "The unfiltered data global salary distribution exhibits an \"anything goes\" pattern with three slightly higher density modes which are partly related to unequal bin widths. Note that the `100000-124999` bin width is 2.5 times wider than the `90000-99999` bin width.   Similarly, if we construct equal size bins by joining the `7500-9999` and the `5000-7499` bins, we will get higher values than the `10000-14999` bin. Even worse, what literaly sticks out is the `0-999` bin suggesting that almost one in five Data Scientists globaly earn less than on thousand USD per year.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, this is related to spam, user-error or, possibly, part-time employement values. The picture is not as bleak after filtering the data. The filtered data global salary distribution values increase significantly, _from 25\\% to 30\\%_, and the density of the three main modes and of their neighboring bins also increases relative to their unfiltered values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The three modes indicate hidden patterns in the data resulting in this distribution shape.   Therefore, we examine the salary distribution:  \n",

Some participants from countries belonging to this group, might be have been classified in the \"Other\" country category. Unfortunately, this information is not available to us."

    "## US salary distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the filtered data, we get a clearer idea about what to expect working as a data scientist in the US.  We should expect, 97% of the times, a minimum staring salary above 70000.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We find that the US salary distribution is even more concentrated in the 90k to the 200k range. Resembling one standard deviation analysis without calculating the mean, we find that more than 70% of salary observations are in the 90k to the 200k range. The reason we choose the 90-99k bin instead of the 200-249k bin in order to calculate the cumulative percentage of 70% of observations has to do with the relative bin widths as discussed previously.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we combine the bins from 70k to 99k, we get a single bin whose value is ~18.3% and with greater width compared to the 100-125k bin.  Similarly, if we split the 150-199k bin in half, we get two bins of the same width and whose values will be ~11.5%. Using this information we conclude that the mode of the distribution lies in the 100-125k bin, while the median lies in the 125-149k bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, even though most of the observations (23%) are in the 150k-199k range this is an optical illusion. This should be noted so that readers get a better understaning of the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the mode midpoint (112.5k) that we infer by examing the data and the adjusted bins, we find that the mode mid-point is higher by two thirds compared to the US average salary ($68700). Additionally, the median is approximately double than the average salary.\n",

    "\n",
    "Being one fifth of the data it is necesary to focus on the Salary distibution of India.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the filtered data, we find that the Data Scientists salary distribution in India spreads out along a wide range of values. As expected, after excluding data that suggested that one third of Data Scientists earn less than 25% of the country average, we can make more reliable inferences. Note that there are no observations in the top salary bins despite setting lenient rejection thresholds. This highlights the importance of filtering criteria that may capture a small part of total data, but nevertheless, play an important role when examining subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking into account the unequal bin size we can see that 69.3% of the observations are in the 4k-4999 range. This resonates with the fact the India is classified by the World Bank as a \"Lower Middle\" income country.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we calculate the cumulative percentages of the distribution, we do not include the 40k-49999 bin. Instead, we include the 4k-4999 bin, despite the fact that both bins have similar density. We do so because the 40-49999 bin is 10 times wider. Simalarly, by examining bin widths, we find that the distribution density mode is at the 5k-9999 area (15.7%) including almost 10% more observations than the 10k-14999 bin. Interestingly, the mode bin midpoint (7500) is almost four times larger than the country average salary we use to set the rejection threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evidence adds support to the general intuition that Data Scentists' salaries are considerably higher than the average country salaries. It also indicates that our salary value rejection criteria were lenient indeed.  As a final note, by examining the filtered data graph, we find evidence that being intentionally lenient, we have allowed a part of non-normal values to remain in the dataset in the 1000-1999 bin. This infulences the salary distribution and indicates that salaries might actually be higher."

Still, 36% of values are above the 100k threshold and there is a two-modal pattern in the distribution.

Towards that goal we use data from official economic databases and create a new dataset which can be used as a proxy for the average salary on a global scale. Using this dataset we define a set of conditions with which we identify additional spam observations. We took extra care to avoid dropping possible outliers. \n",

    "The first thing that sticks out besides the \"completion\" time is the large number of observations with reported salaries in the 0-999 bin, regardless of country.  From the salary distributions graphs it becomes apparent that the dataset contains a large amount of \"spam\".  A simple approach would be a \"brute-force\" one, e.g. to drop all observations that report salaries below 2000 USD for all \"Upper Middle\" and \"High Income\" countries. Nevertheless, given the wide variety of other \"unacceptable values\" in different dimensions and the wide cross-country economic differences, we chose to construct country-adjusted rejection thresholds.\n",

    "As a general rule for this analysis, and in order not to lose information about an arguably high variance dataset, we set as a goal to avoid dropping observations that could be falsely identified as spam, i.e. we want minimum False Positives.  Consequently, observations that should be dropped remain in the dataset, i.e we acknowledge that our filters will allow false Negatives (i.e. observations that are classified as non-spam, despite being spam).  This decision intentionally sacrifices accuracy for retaining valuable information.\n",
