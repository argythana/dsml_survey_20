## Overview

The Kaggle DS & ML Survey is an open online survey receiving thousands of responses from all over the world. In its uniqueness if offers valuable insights to all interested parties.

Being a global online survey it is affected by a factor that Machine Learning is famous for mitigating: spam.
According to the "Kaggle Survey Methodology", respondents that were flagged by the survey system as "spam" have been excluded from the results.

Using Exploratory Data Analysis we show that a significant part of the data can still be classified as spam, without dropping any observations that might be outliers. Filtering out these observations we get significantly different results from the official "Executive Summary".

Furthermore, we explore the data by controlling for the wide global diversity that exists among country salary levels. To achieve this, we used all available official sources and created a combined data set.

Thirdly, we reconstruct the various classes (bins) in which the data are provided, aiming an extra perspective on current and future trends. 

Combining the three above features, our insights add to the understanding of the data, providing clues to students, professionals and interested companies  in order to optimize their strategy.

To assist interested parties with reproducing our methodology we have created functions, which may be parameterized differently for setting spam filtering thresholds.

Using In the Appendix, we provide a set of suggestions for future Kaggle online surveys.
